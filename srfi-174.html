<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>This SRFI defines the trivial type <i>timespec</i>, which is used
to represent the <code>struct timespec</code> defined by the
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/time.h.html">
P<small>OSIX</small> <code>&lt;time.h&gt;</code> header</a>.</p>

<h1>Issues</h1>

None at present.

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>The reason for putting this very simple and straightforward type
into a SRFI (and library) of its own is that timespecs are part of the
interface for more than one SRFI.  If they are defined in just
one SRFI and imported by the rest, that produces an otherwise useless
and unnecessary dependency on the SRFI containing the definition.
This arises particularly
in R6RS and R7RS because record types are generative (distinct
definitions lead to distinct record types) and because most implementations
report a warning or even an error if the same identifier is imported from
more than one library, unless they have both imported it in turn
from the same original library.</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<p>Timespec is an immutable type that contains two exact integer values.
The first value is the number of seconds
since a particular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(computing)">
epoch</a>,
but normally excluding all leap seconds that have occurred since then.
The minimum range of values is 2<sup>-39</i> (inclusive)
to 2<sup>39/i> (exclusive), allowing a range of at least 15,000 years before and after the epoch.
The second value is the number of nanoseconds since the beginning of the specified second.
It is a non-negative integer less than 10<sup>9</sup>.</p>

<p>It is recommended, but not required, that timespecs
be a disjoint type, but for efficiency's sake they may be represented
otherwise in particular implementations.  If they are not disjoint, the
exact representation (such as a pair) must be documented
by the implementation.
It is an error to mutate the values held in a timespec object.
Note that IEEE 64-bit floats are <i>not</i> a sufficient representation,
because their nanosecond-precision range is confined to a period of 208 days
centered on the epoch.</p>

<h2>Procedures</h2>

<p><code>(timespec </code><i>seconds nanoseconds</i><code>)</code></p>

<p>Returns a timespec containing <i>seconds</i> and <i>nanoseconds</i>.

<p><code>(timespec? </code><i>obj</i><code>)</code></p>

<p>Returns <code>#f</code> if <i>obj</i> is definitely not a timespec,
and <code>#t</code> if it is most probably one.</p>

<p>If timespecs are a disjoint type, this procedure simply tests whether
<i>obj</i> belongs to that type.  If not, then each component
is checked to see if it is an exact integer, and in the case
of the nanoseconds component, whether it is a non-negative integer
less than 10<sup>9</sup>.

<p>In addition, if the implementation knows that its fixnum width is at least 40 bits,
it can also check that the value of the seconds component is a fixnum.</p>

<p><code>(timespec-seconds </code><i>timespec</i></code></p>

<p>Returns the seconds component of <i>timespec</i>.
The result must be the same (in the sense of <code>eqv?</code>)
to the value passed to <code>timespec</code>.</p>

<p><code>(timespec-nanoseconds </code><i>timespec</i></code></p>

<p>Returns the nanoseconds component of <i>timespec</i>.
The result must be the same (in the sense of <code>eqv?</code>)
to the value passed to <code>timespec</code>.</p>

<p><code>timespec-comparator</code></p>

<p>This variable (not a procedure) is a comparator object for
timespecs, ordering them by the total number of nanoseconds.
A simple hash function is also provided.</p>

<p>Note that it is an (undetectable) error to compare two
timespecs that are relative to different epochs.</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>Two implementations of SRFI 174 are in the repository of this SRFI.
The files are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>srfi/174.sld</code> - uses a disjoint type</li>
<li><code>srfi/pair-174.sld</code> - uses a pair</li>
<li><code>chibi-tests.scm</code> - Tests using <code>(chibi tests)</code></li>
<li><code>chibi-tests-pair.scm</code> - Tests for <code>(srfi pair-174)</code></li>
</ul>


<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

<p>Discussions between me, Lassi Kortela, and Harold Ancell, mostly on the
<a href="https://srfi-email.schemers.org/srfi-170/">SRFI 170
mailing list</a>, made the need for this SRFI clear.</p>
